# Energy management systems for hybrid AC/DC microgrids

The universal energy management system for a microgrid park.
The microgrid park is a cluster of microgrids (MGs).
One MG is the aggregrated representation of the local sources, i.e. generators, loads, energy storage systems(ESSs) and convertors. The MG can be AC/DC/hybrid AC-DC. The connection between the AC side and DC side of the MG is realized via the convertors. The MGs are connected through DC transmission lines.

The universal ems is the platform for multiple MGs, and the management of networks in the MG park.

This work is supported by national research foundation in Singapore, and is under developing.

This is the second version of energy management system. We intend to develop a smart, distributed and robust energy management system for the Internet of things (IoT) embeded system.
